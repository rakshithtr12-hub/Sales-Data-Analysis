## Approach Used

### 1. Data Wrangling

- Examine the data to detect any NULL or missing values.
- Since `NOT NULL` constraints were applied during table creation, there are no null values present in the dataset.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Generate new insights by creating the following columns:

- `time_of_day`: Classify each transaction as Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
- `day_name`: Extract the day of the week from each transaction.
- `month_name`: Extract the month from each transaction.

These columns help analyze when sales peak during the day, week, or month.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted to address the project's key questions and objectives.
